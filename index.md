# <center>Welcome to my GitHub homepage!<center>

This is a web page that gathers and lists some public work on which I've taken part in.

## General

\- [LycanSec](https://lycansec.wordpress.com/), a website about tech on which I write with some friends;

## Computer Science

\- The [live demonstrations](https://oliveiraleo.github.io/CG/works/) of the works I presented in the **Computer Graphics** course;

\- A [work](https://github.com/oliveiraleo/PO-DEMLURB) based on the Chinese Postman Problem presented in the **Operational Research** course;

\- The [source code](https://github.com/oliveiraleo/2035015-Final_Work) and results of the final task of the **Computer Networks** course. The task consisted of building a Linux-based environment and test the behaviour of TCP, UDP and ICMP protocols in four different setups;

\- A [small colection](https://github.com/oliveiraleo/DCC075-Seguranca-Final_Work) of very simple scripts that can be used during the information gathering step of a network pentest presented in the **Security of Systems** course;

\- [River Raid](https://github.com/roddysilv/DCC148_River_Raid) & [Dodger Reloaded](https://github.com/oliveiraleo/DCC148-Dodger_Reloaded), two remakes of oldschool popular games and [Critical Velocity Riders](https://github.com/roddysilv/DCC148_Critital_Velocity_Riders) a single player race game prototype. All of them were developed using the Unity Engine during the **Games Development** course;

## Privacy

\- An one hour long introductory talk (entitled "They are watching us") about government mass surveillance and the Edward Snowden's revelations (currently available at [Odysee](https://odysee.com/@leo_http:5/they:9d) and [LBRY](lbry://@leo_http:5/they:9d));

## LoRa/LoRaWAN

\- A [repository](https://github.com/oliveiraleo/LoRa) containing materials regarding the LoRa radio frequency transmission technology and LoRaWAN network protocol;

\- [RSSginal](https://github.com/oliveiraleo/RSSignal-LoRa): an open source framework for generating and validating keys using the RSSI as input;

\- [LoRa RSSI Grabber](https://github.com/oliveiraleo/LoRa-RSSI-Grabber): a framework to collect and store RSSI measurements obtained using mDot LoRa devices;

\- A publicly avaliable LoRa [dataset](https://github.com/oliveiraleo/LoRa-RSSI-dataset-outdoor) containing RSSI measurements from five surveys in different conditions.

This page is a work in progress, from time to time I will update it. I hope anything here helps you.

See you around!
