# <center>Welcome to my github homepage!</center>

This is a web page that gathers and lists some public work on which I've taken part in:

\- A website about tech on which I write with some friends;

\- The live demonstrations of the works I presented at the Computer Graphics (*Computação Gráfica* - CG) course;

\- A work based on the Chinese Postman Problem presented on the Operational Research (*Pesquisa Operacional* - PO) course;

\- A repository with materials about the LoRa radio frequency transmission technology and LoRaWAN network protocol;

\- An introductory (and extensive) talk about government mass surveillance and the Edward Snowden's revelations.
