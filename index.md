# <p style="text-align: center;">Welcome to my GitHub homepage!</p>

This is a web page that gathers and lists some public work on which I've taken part in:

\- [LycanSec](https://lycansec.wordpress.com/), a website about tech on which I write with some friends;

\- The [live demonstrations](https://oliveiraleo.github.io/CG/works/) of the works I presented in the Computer Graphics course;

\- A [work](https://github.com/oliveiraleo/PO-DEMLURB) based on the Chinese Postman Problem presented in the Operational Research course;

\- A [repository](https://github.com/oliveiraleo/LoRa) containing materials regarding the LoRa radio frequency transmission technology and LoRaWAN network protocol;

\- An introductory (and extensive) talk (entitled "They are watching us") about government mass surveillance and the Edward Snowden's revelations (currently available at [Odysee](https://odysee.com/@leo_http:5/they:9d) and [LBRY](lbry://@leo_http:5/they:9d)).

This page is a work in progress, from time to time I will update it. I hope anything here helps you.

See you around!
