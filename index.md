\- [LoRa RSSI Grabber](https://github.com/oliveiraleo/LoRa-RSSI-Grabber): a framework to collect and store RSSI measurements obtained using mDot LoRa devices;

\- A publicly avaliable LoRa [dataset](https://github.com/oliveiraleo/LoRa-RSSI-dataset-outdoor) containing RSSI measurements from five surveys in different conditions.
